Roberta Leigh was an assumed name for Rita Lewin ( n√©e Shulman ) ( 22 December 1926 -- 19 December 2014 ) was a British author , artist and television producer . She wrote romance fiction and children 's stories under the pseudonyms Roberta Leigh , Rachel Lindsay , Janey Scott , Rozella Lake and Roumelia Lane . She published her first novel in 1950 and was still actively working on new titles until a year before her death . In addition , she created the children 's puppet television series Sara and Hoppity , Torchy the Battery Boy , Wonder Boy and Tiger , Send for Dithers and Space Patrol ( the last of which she also wrote and produced ) . Best known as Roberta Leigh , she was born Rita Shulman in London to sometimes - poor Jewish parents who had emigrated from Russia . In 1948 , she married Michael Lewin , with whom she had one son , and was widowed in 1981 . She died age 87 on 19 December 2014 . Leigh wrote her first romantic fiction at age 14 , while still a schoolgirl at St Mary 's convent in Rhyl . She published a romance in 1950 as Roberta Leigh , the first of over 160 novels . She also published children 's books and romances under the pseudonyms Janey Scott , Rachel Lindsay and Rozella Lake . Following the death of her husband , she stopped writing romance novels , but continued to produce serious fiction and children 's books while developing various television and film projects . She made a total of 275 cinematic works , becoming the first woman producer in Britain to have her own film company . She created eight puppet TV series , including The Adventures Of Twizzle ( 1957 ) , Torchy the Battery Boy ( 1958 ) , Sara and Hoppity ( 1962 ) , Wonder Boy and Tiger , Send for Dithers , and Space Patrol ( 1962 ) , - syndicated around the globe and achieving the highest ratings of any children 's show up to that time - which chronicled the year 2100 adventures of Captain Larry Dart of the spaceship Galasphere 347 . This was followed by Paul Starr ( 1964 ) and a live - action colour space adventure series , The Solarnauts ( 1967 ) . For these two later series , however , only the pilot episodes were filmed . Though made in 1964 , Paul Starr appeared to be a decade ahead of Space Patrol . A 25 - minute marionette puppet series in the same vein as Space Patrol , it was produced in colour . Agent Paul Starr and his crewman , Lightning , work for Space Bureau Investigation ( SBI ) . They have a squat rocket , SBI - 5 , which can travel through space , in air and underwater ( SBI uses an undersea base ) . While jets propel the craft through the air , in space it is powered by `` solar energy '' . It is armed with various weapons , including nuclear missiles . The robots of Paul Starr appear to be more developed and fans of Space Patrol will notice the similar sound effects used . The movements of the puppet characters are `` less wooden '' and there is no sign of strings . The puppets were made by Martin and Heather Granger who , with Joan Garrick , also operated them . Realistic mouth movements were used long before the arrival of Gerry Anderson 's Terrahawks in the 1980s . Actor Edward Bishop provided the voice of Paul Starr ; other voices were provided by Patricia English , Dick Vosburgh and Peter Reeves . Besides creating and scripting the series , Leigh also wrote the title song and lyrics ( sung by Jerry Dane ) . Arthur Provis served as director of photography and co-producer . In this adventure , Starr 's boss sends him to Mars where five atomic power stations ( used to pump water ) have been destroyed by fire . Starr and Lightning work as security guards to try to uncover the cause . The chief suspect is General Darynx . The Martians are shown as non-human fish people . This was a colour live - action space adventure TV series , produced in 1967 . Like Paul Starr , its filmed material survives . Books credited to Roberta Leigh , Rachel Lindsay , Janey Scott or Rozella Lake . Some novels were credited to both Roberta Leigh and Rachel Lindsay .
