1414 Jérôme , provisional designation 1937 CE , is a somewhat eccentric , carbonaceous asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt , about 17 kilometers in diameter . It was discovered on 12 February 1937 by French astronomer Louis Boyer at Algiers Observatory , Algeria , in northern Africa . The dark C - type asteroid , classified as a Ch - subtype in the SMASS classification scheme , which have a typical absorption feature in the visible red light , orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.3 -- 3.2 AU once every 4 years and 8 months ( 1,697 days ) . Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.16 and is tilted by 9 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic . It has an albedo of 0.065 . Although the body 's diameter and albedo were measured by four observations made by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite , IRAS , little is known about the asteroid , with its rotation period remaining unknown , despite having a well - observed orbit with the lowest possible uncertainty , or condition code , of 0 and an observation arc that spans over a period of almost 80 years . The minor planet was named by the discoverer in honour of his father , Jérôme Boyer .
