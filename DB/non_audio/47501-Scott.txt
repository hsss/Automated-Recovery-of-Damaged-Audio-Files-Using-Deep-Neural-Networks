Scott Jackson Crichton ( born June 1 , 1954 ) is a Republican member of the Louisiana Supreme Court . He was a judge of the Louisiana 1st Judicial District Court in Shreveport from 1991 to 2014 . Crichton was elected to the court in 1990 as a Democrat . In 2014 , he ran without opposition to succeed the retiring Justice Jeffrey P. Victory for the District 2 seat on the seven - member state Supreme Court . The nonpartisan blanket primary for the position was held on November 4 , 2014 in eleven northwest Louisiana parishes . Crichton ( pronounced CRA TON ) is the son of Thomas Crichton , III ( 1917 − 1989 ) , who though born in Monroe was a businessman - landholder descended from a pioneer family in Minden in Webster Parish east of Shreveport . His mother , the former Mary Murff ( 1919 − 1983 ) , was a native of Shreveport ; her grandfather was a district court judge in 1906 . Crichton himself was born in Shreveport but attended school for the first eight years in Minden . For high school , he was sent to the private boarding school , the Webb School in Bell Buckle in Bedford County near Shelbyville in middle Tennessee . The school then had an enrollment of only two hundred but with a demanding curriculum , honor code , and required obstacle courses including the development of survival skills . After graduation from the Webb School , Crichton attended Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge , from which he received his undergraduate degree in 1976 . In 1980 , he received his Juris Doctor degree from the Louisiana State University Law Center . He and his wife , the former Susan `` Susie '' Simonton ( born November 23 , 1957 ) , whom he married c. 1986 , have two sons , Stuart Jackson Crichton ( a 2013 LSU Law school graduate ) and Sam Crichton ( a 2014 LSU Law school graduate ) . Since 1985 , the judge has been a member of St. Mark 's Episcopal Cathedral in Shreveport . From 1981 until 1990 , Judge Crichton was a Caddo Parish assistant district attorney under the DA Paul Carmouche , in which capacity he prosecuted felonies , including capital murder . From 1985 to 1990 , he also maintained a civil law practice . On December 8 , 1990 , Crichton defeated another Democrat , Charles C. Grubb , for the Division C seat on the 1st District Court , 11,053 ( 55.6 percent ) to 8,844 ( 44.5 percent ) . The position was vacated by the retiring Democrat C. J. Bolin . Crichton was unopposed for subsequent six - year terms on the district court in 1996 , 2002 , and 2008 . As a district judge , Crichton has handled more than 25,000 criminal and civil cases . He is a former instructor at the Shreveport Police Academy . From 2011 to 2012 , he was the president of the Louisiana District Judges Association . He is a former board member of the YMCA and a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association . Justice Victory had been expected to seek a third ten - year term on the Louisiana Supreme Court , but Victory , who is eight years Crichton 's senior , announced in August 2013 his retirement from the bench , effective December 31 , 2014 . Because Judge Crichton will have turned sixty by the time of the 2014 election , he can seek only one term on the Supreme Court because Louisiana state law forbids a lawyer aged seventy or above from qualifying for a judicial position . Judge Crichton is known for his conservative rulings and avoidance of judicial activism . Outside the courtroom , he works with elementary and high school students with his `` Do n't Let This Be You '' program , which focuses upon such subjects as drinking and driving , sexting , and recently personal defense . More than 500 people attended Crichton 's campaign kickoff party on April 29 , 2013 , at Ernest 's Orleans Restaurant in Shreveport . Among those in attendance were fellow judges and law enforcement officials from around the state . Had he drawn an opponent , Crichton 's campaign was to have been co-managed by his wife Susie and Carolyn Prator , the wife of Crichton 's friend , Caddo Parish Sheriff Steve Prator .
